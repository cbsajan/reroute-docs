REROUTE brings the simplicity and elegance of Next.js-style file-based routing to Python web frameworks. Build clean, maintainable APIs with zero configuration.

---

## Features

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **File-based Routing**

    ---

    Organize routes by folders and files, just like Next.js. No manual route registration needed. Your folder structure becomes your API structure.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](guides/file-routing.md)

-   **Class-based Handlers**

    ---

    HTTP methods as class methods: `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `delete()`. Clean, intuitive, and Pythonic approach to API development.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](guides/class-routes.md)

-   **Powerful Decorators**

    ---

    Built-in rate limiting, caching, validation, and authentication. Extend functionality with custom decorators easily.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](guides/decorators.md)

-   **Multi-framework Support**

    ---

    Works with FastAPI and Flask. Django coming soon. Switch frameworks without rewriting your route logic.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Adapters](adapters/index.md)

-   **Security Headers**

    ---

    OWASP-compliant security headers out of the box. CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and more - configured automatically.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Security](guides/security.md)

-   **CLI Scaffolding**

    ---

    Generate projects, routes, and models with CLI commands. `reroute init` and `reroute create` for rapid development.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI or Flask

### Installation

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install reroute[fastapi]
    ```

=== "uv (faster)"

    ```bash
    uv pip install reroute[fastapi]
    ```

### Create a Project

<div class="termy">

```console
$ reroute init my-app --framework fastapi

? Would you like to set up a database? No

==================================================
Project Configuration Review
==================================================
  Project Name: my-app
  Framework: FASTAPI
  Host: 0.0.0.0
  Port: 7376
  Include Tests: Yes
==================================================

? Does this look correct? Yes

Creating project: my-app

  [ OK ] Creating project structure

### Generate a Route

<div class="termy">

```console
$ reroute create route --path /users --name User --methods GET,POST

  [ OK ] Creating route directory
  [ OK ] Generating route file

==================================================
[SUCCESS] Route created successfully!
==================================================

  Route: /users
  File: app/routes/users/page.py
  Methods: GET, POST
  Tag: User
```

</div>

This creates `app/routes/users/page.py`:

```python
from reroute import RouteBase
from reroute.decorators import cache, rate_limit

class UserRoutes(RouteBase):
    """User API endpoints."""

    tag = "Users"

    @cache(duration=60)
    def get(self):
        """Get all users."""
        return {"users": ["Alice", "Bob"]}

    @rate_limit("10/min")
    def post(self):
        """Create a new user."""
        return {"message": "User created", "id": 1}
```

### Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

- **Users Endpoint**: [http://localhost:8000/users](http://localhost:8000/users)

## How It Works

Your folder structure becomes your API routes:

```
app/routes/
    users/
        page.py          -> /users
        [id]/
            page.py      -> /users/{id}
    products/
        page.py          -> /products
        categories/
            page.py      -> /products/categories
```

Each `page.py` contains a class inheriting from `RouteBase` with HTTP methods:

```python
from reroute import RouteBase

class UserRoutes(RouteBase):
    def get(self):
        """Handle GET requests."""
        return {"users": [...]}

    def post(self):
        """Handle POST requests."""
        return {"message": "Created"}

    def put(self, id: int):
        """Handle PUT requests."""
        return {"message": f"Updated {id}"}

    def delete(self, id: int):
        """Handle DELETE requests."""
        return {"message": f"Deleted {id}"}
```
